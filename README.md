# Cpp-Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a variety of C++ projects focused on demonstrating skills in different aspects of programming, from basic operations to complex data structures. Each project is categorized by specific programming concepts.

## Projects

## First semester

### A - Dice poker
    -- input/output operations, conditional statements, and variable handling.

### B - Array operations
    -- input/output operations, loops, and array handling. ￼
    
### C - Collective functions
    -- function definitions, array handling, and algorithm implementation. 
    
### D - Data cube
    -- multidimensional arrays, function definitions, and geometric computations.
    
### E - Storehouse
    -- struct definitions, nested structures, function definitions, and pointer manipulation
    
### F - File operations
    -- file input/output, struct definitions, and file handling functions.
    
### G - Strings
    -- string manipulation, function definitions, and operations on strings.


## Second semester:

### A - Bit operations
    -- bit manipulation functions (with bit set defined by integer), struct definitions, and operations using bitwise operators.
    
### B - Functions
    -- variadic functions, interpreting strings as REALLY long numbers and manipulations on them. 
    
### C - Two-dimensional dynamic array
    -- dynamic memory allocation, array manipulation, and pointer operations. 
    (C language)
    
### D - Fruit garden
    -- classes, dynamic memory management, and object-oriented programming principles such as constructors, destructors, and class member functions.
    
### E - Olympics
    -- classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### F - Polynomials
    -- class definitions, dynamic memory allocation, variadic functions, and arithmetic operations on polynomials.
